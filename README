Setup steps:

1) Download Z3, and copy the include and lib files to z3/[z3version]/include and
z3/[z3version]/lib respectively. (eg: z3/2.19/include/z3.h and
z3/2.19/lib/libz3.so).

2) Download sbt. Run 'sbt update' from the current directory.

3) Run 'sbt package' to create the jar file. It will be in
target/[scalaversion]/scalaz3.jar and will contain the shared library required
by the bindings.

4) For testing, run 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=z3/[z3version]/lib sbt test'.
